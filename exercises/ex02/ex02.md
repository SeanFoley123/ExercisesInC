# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
  intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
  expected?
  - It seems like the idea is to initialize an array of all 42s with foo, change it so that the values count from 0 to SIZE-1 using bar, and then print each value out one at a time.
2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?
    - First, we get a warning in foo. The issue seems to be that we're trying to directly return an array of values instead of a pointer to that array.
3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
  some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
  helpful to draw a stack diagram.
  - I just got a segmentation fault.
4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
  it again.  What happens now?
5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
  then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!



Notes to self: Compile with -g flag for debug, then run gdb with your compiled program
